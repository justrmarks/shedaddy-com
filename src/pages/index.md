  title: She Daddy is re-defining how we keep our spaces safe and universal
  description: For the most marginalized communities, we can't wait for Society to notice our sufferings, our concerns, our traumas. We need survival now. We need the means to thrive now. We can't just wait for revolution, we need be revolutionary NOW. This means bringing people with the tools and knowledge to the people taking action. She Daddy is hopefully one means to this end. Sharing knowledge and tools not as an expert, but as an individual committed to creating better communities today through coalition.
